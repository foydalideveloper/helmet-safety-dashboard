##  Features

- **Real-Time Object Detection:** Utilizes a custom-trained YOLOv8 model to detect 'helmet' and 'head' (no helmet) classes in video streams.
- **Interactive Web Dashboard:** A user-friendly interface built with Gradio for easy video upload and analysis.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Generates detailed statistics for each analysis, including total violations, severity breakdowns, and performance metrics.
- **Violation Evidence:** Automatically captures and displays image snapshots of frames where a safety violation is detected.
- **Detection Zones:** Users can define specific rectangular zones within the video frame to focus the analysis on critical areas.
- **Data Persistence:** All detected violations are saved to an SQLite database, enabling historical data review.
- **Historical Trends:** An interactive dashboard to visualize violation trends over time.
- **Alerting System:** Flags periods of high violation frequency based on a configurable threshold.
